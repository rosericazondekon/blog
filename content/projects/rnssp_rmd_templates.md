The Rnssp R Markdown Templates are extensions to the Rnssp R package. Rnssp R Markdown templates are custom-built, parameterized R Markdown templates with seamless integration to the Rnssp R package to enhance user experiences and streamline workflows.

These templates are developed in collaboration with the members of the Community of Practice (CoP) and the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP).

The goal is to make a wide collection of report templates accessible and easily distributable via the Rnssp R package.
