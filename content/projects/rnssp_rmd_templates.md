The Rnssp R Markdown Templates are extensions to the Rnssp R package. These templates are developed in collaboration with the members of the Community of Practice (CoP) and the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP).

The goal is to make a wide collection of report templates accessible and easily distributable via the Rnssp R package.
