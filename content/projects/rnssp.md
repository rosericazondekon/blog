The `Rnssp` R package is a catalog of data processing and analytics tools, templates, and functions commonly used across the National Syndromic and Surveillance Program (NSSP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Its goal is to improve code reproducibility, standardize and document reusable functions, facilitate the sharing of routine reports across the NSSP Community of Practice (CoP), and better engage the NSSP CoP.

The NSSP is a collaboration among CDC programs, federal partners, and local and state jurisdiction who participatein an active CoP. Various tools and analytical resources have been developed by the NSSP to assist partners across the CoP.

The `Rnssp` R package continues this effort by improving analytic reusability, reproducibility, and the distribution of resources to robustly support technical capacity building within the CoP.
